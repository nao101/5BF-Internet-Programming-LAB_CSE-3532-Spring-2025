# 💪 AI Gym Assistant

The **AI Gym Assistant** is a computer vision-based fitness tool that helps users monitor and count exercise repetitions in real time. Utilizing the webcam and AI-powered pose estimation, it tracks user movement during arm curls and squats, providing immediate visual feedback and a counter for each exercise.

## 📝 Project Description

This project uses MediaPipe's pose detection and OpenCV to analyze body posture from webcam input. It calculates joint angles to identify exercise stages and automatically counts reps. A simple GUI built with Tkinter allows users to choose between tracking **arm curls** or **squats**.

This assistant is ideal for users who want to train at home and track their form and progress without the need for gym equipment or personal trainers.
